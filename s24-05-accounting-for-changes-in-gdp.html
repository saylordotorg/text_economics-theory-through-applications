        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_p07">Growth accounting tells us how <em class="emphasis">changes</em> in real GDP in an economy are due to <em class="emphasis">changes</em> in available inputs. Under reasonably general circumstances, the change in output in an economy can be written as follows:</p>
        <span class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase">output growth rate = <em class="emphasis">a</em> × capital stock growth rate</span></span>

        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_p08">In this equation, <em class="emphasis">a</em> is just a number. Growth rates can be positive or negative, so we can use the equation to analyze decreases and increases in GDP.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_p09">We can measure the growth in output, capital stock, and labor hours using easily available economic data. The growth rate of human capital is trickier to measure, although we can use information on schooling and literacy rates to estimate this number. We also have a way of measuring <em class="emphasis">a</em>. The technical details are not important here, but a good measure of (1 − <em class="emphasis">a</em>) is simply total payments to labor in the economy (that is, the total of wages and other compensation) as a fraction of overall GDP. For most economies, <em class="emphasis">a</em> is in the range of about 1/3 to 1/2.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_p10">For the United States, the number <em class="emphasis">a</em> is about 1/3. The growth rate of output is therefore given as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_p11">Because we can measure everything in this equation except growth in technology, we can use the equation to determine what the growth rate of technology must be. If we rearrange, we get the following:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s01_p02">Growth accounting is an extremely useful tool because it helps us diagnose the causes of economic success and failure. We can look at successful growing economies and find out if they are growing because they have more capital, labor, or skills or because they have improved their technological know-how. Likewise, we can look at economies in which output has fallen and find out whether declines in capital, labor, or technology are responsible.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn20_023">We use this tool in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch22#cooperecon-ch22">Chapter 22 "The Great Depression"</a> to study the behavior of the US economy in the 1920s and 1930s.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s01_p03">Researchers have found that different countries and regions of the world have vastly varying experiences when viewed through the lens of growth accounting.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Short Run, the Long Run, and the Very Long Run</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_p01">Growth accounting focuses on how inputs—and hence output—change over time. We use the tool both to look at changes in an economy over short time periods—say, from one month to the next—and also over very long time periods—say, over decades. We are limited only by the data that we have available to us. It is sometimes useful to distinguish three different time horizons.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>The short run refers to a period of time that we would typically measure in months. If something has only a short-run effect on an economy, the effect will vanish within months or a few years at most.</li>
            <li>The long run refers to periods of time that are better measured in years. If something will happen in the long run, we might have to wait for two, three, or more years before it happens.</li>
            <li>The very long run refers to periods of time that are best measured in decades.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_p02">These definitions of the short, long, and very long runs are not and cannot be very exact. In the context of particular chapters, however, we give more precise definitions to these ideas.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn20_025">For example, <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch25#cooperecon-ch25">Chapter 25 "Understanding the Fed"</a> explains the adjustment of prices in an economy. In that chapter, we define the short run as the time horizon in which prices are “sticky”—not all prices have adjusted fully—whereas the long run refers to a period where all prices have fully adjusted. Meanwhile, <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch21#cooperecon-ch21">Chapter 21 "Global Prosperity and Global Poverty"</a> uses the very long run to refer to a situation where output and the physical capital stock grow at the same rate.</span> <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_f01">Figure 20.11 "The Different Time Horizons in Economics"</a> summarizes the main influences on the inputs to the production function in the short run, the long run, and the very long run.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_p03">Look first at physical capital—the first row in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_f01">Figure 20.11 "The Different Time Horizons in Economics"</a>. In the short run, the amount of physical capital in the economy is more or less fixed. There are a certain number of machines, buildings, and so on, and we cannot make big changes in this capital stock. One thing that firms can do in the short run is to change capital utilization—shutting down a production line if they want to produce less output or running extra shifts if they want more output. Once we move to the long run and very long run, capital mobility and capital accumulation become important.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_p04">Look next at labor. In the short run, the amount of labor in the production function depends primarily on how much labor firms want to hire (labor demand) and how much people want to work (labor supply). As we move to the long run, migration of labor becomes significant as well: workers sometimes move from one country to another in search of better jobs. And, in the very long run, population growth and other demographic changes (the aging of the population, the increased entry of women into the labor force, etc.) start to matter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_p05">Human capital can be increased in the long run (and also in the short run to some extent) by training. The most important changes in human capital come in the very long run, however, through improved education.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_p06">There is not very much that can be done to change a country’s technology in the short run. In the long run, less technologically advanced countries can import better technologies from other countries. In practice, this often happens as a result of a multinational firm establishing operations in a developing country. For example, if Dell Inc. establishes a factory in Mexico, then it effectively transfers some know-how to the Mexican economy. This is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">technology transfer</a><span class="glossdef">The movement of knowledge and advanced production techniques across national borders.</span></span>, the movement of knowledge and advanced production techniques across national borders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s05_s02_p07">In the long run and very long run, technology advances through innovation and the hard work of research and development (R&amp;D) that—hopefully—gives us new inventions. In the very long run, countries may be able to improve their institutions and thus create better social infrastructure. In the very long run, declines in natural resources also become significant.</p>
