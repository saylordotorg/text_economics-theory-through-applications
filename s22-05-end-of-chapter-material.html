        <h3 class="title">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch18_s05_p01">Understanding the meaning and measurement of macroeconomic variables is vital for your ability to evaluate the abundance of information you receive through various forms of the media about the state of the aggregate economy. The difficulties faced by the team of International Monetary Fund (IMF) economists with which we opened the chapter are not that different from the problems each of us faces in understanding what is happening in the economy.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch18_s05_p02">The concepts and variables you have discovered in this chapter are used over and over again in the various applications discussed in this book. We use the concepts of real gross domestic product (real GDP), the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, and so forth almost everywhere in our study of macroeconomics.</p>

                    <li>The number of cars parked on the street where you live.</li>
                    <li>The number of cars that drive past your house every day.</li>
                    <li>The number of people losing their jobs and becoming unemployed.</li>
                    <li>The blue jeans on the shelves of a GAP store.</li>
                    <li>The amount of water in a reservoir.</li>
                    <li>The amount of money you have on your person right now.</li>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Suppose an economy produces at least as much—and maybe more—of every good and service this year compared to last year. Also suppose that the price of every single good and service is at least as high this year as it was last year. What, if anything, can you conclude about nominal GDP, real GDP, and the price level between the two years?</li>
            <li>Why do we exclude intermediate goods when calculating GDP?</li>
            <li>Redo <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch18_s01#cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s02_t01">Table 18.3 "Real GDP Using 2012 as the Base Year"</a> assuming that 2013 is the base year.</li>
            <li>Suppose that Australia had nominal GDP last year equal to 1 trillion Australian dollars and that in the first quarter of this year, its nominal GDP is 252 billion Australian dollars. What is Australia’s annualized growth rate of nominal GDP?</li>
            <li>Suppose that, between 2012 and 2013, a country experiences 3 percent negative inflation (this is known as deflation). In other words, prices are on average 3 percent lower in 2013 compared to 2012. However, the economy also experiences real economic growth of 5 percent. Is nominal GDP in 2013 greater or less than in 2012?</li>
            <li>If nominal GDP in country A grows faster than nominal GDP in country B, what, if anything, can you conclude about the inflation rates in the two countries?</li>
            <li>Suppose that the price of Brazilian coffee decreases. What does that imply for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Germany? What does that imply for the GDP deflator in Japan?</li>
            <li>Is it possible for prices to be increasing and the inflation rate to be decreasing at the same time? Explain why or why not.</li>
            <li>Is it possible for an economy’s production to increase at the same time that total income in the economy decreases? Explain why or why not.</li>
            <li>

            <li>A version of GDP that takes into account environmental effects is called “environmental accounting” or “green accounting.” Use the Internet to find a discussion of this alternative way of calculating GDP. List some of the differences between the usual way of calculating GDP and the environmental or green accounting method. Do other countries employ these alternative measures?</li>
