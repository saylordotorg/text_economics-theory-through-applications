    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_p02">Macroeconomics is data driven. Government statisticians and other organizations gather vast amounts of data on the performance of various aspects of the macroeconomy, and macroeconomists try to make sense of all this information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_p03">If we want to explain economic data, then we first have to get the measurement right, and a big part of this is ensuring that we get the accounting right. To make sure that we do, we begin by constructing simple examples. This is not because a simple example is enough to describe an economy; but because cannot hope to understand the complicated accounting unless we do the simple accounting correctly.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Pizza Economy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s01_p01">To understand the economic health of Argentina—or any other country—we begin by looking at production in the economy. Let us imagine that Argentina produces a single good—pizza. Each pizza is sold for 10 pesos (which is about US$3.33). To be concrete, suppose that every worker in the economy works in a pizza factory in which (1) each hour worked produces 1 pizza, (2) each worker works 40 hours per week, and (3) each worker works 50 weeks per year. Suppose there are about 15 million workers in the economy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s01_p02">We measure total economic activity by determining the <em class="emphasis">total value of the pizzas produced</em> in this economy. We obtain this by multiplying the previous numbers together. There are</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">40 pizzas per worker per week,</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s01_p03">so there are</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">2,000 pizzas per worker per year (= 40 × 50),</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s01_p04">which means that there are</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">30,000,000,000 pizzas per year (= 40 × 50 × 15,000,000).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s01_p05">The value of those pizzas is</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">300,000,000,000 pesos per year (= 40 × 50 × 15,000,000 × 10).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s01_p06">The total value of all the production in the economy is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal gross domestic product (nominal GDP)</a><span class="glossdef">The market value of the final goods and services produced by an economy in a given period of time.</span></span>. The word <em class="emphasis">nominal</em> indicates that something is being measured in terms of money—in this case, Argentine pesos. For this economy, nominal GDP is 300 billion pesos per year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s01_p07">The economy we have just described is extremely stylized and somewhat dull from a culinary perspective. We begin with such a simple economy because it allows us to understand the basic workings of the economy without getting bogged down in a lot of details. We did, however, choose numbers that are the right order of magnitude for the Argentine economy in 2002: the total number of workers in Argentina in 2002 was about 15 million, and nominal GDP was about 300 billion pesos. In 2010, estimated GDP for Argentina was 1.4 trillion pesos, and the workforce was over 16 million.</p>

        <span class="blockquote block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_p02">Nominal GDP is the market value of the final goods and services produced by an economy in a given period of time.</p>

        <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Market Value</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p01">Our example pretended that there was only a single good produced in the economy—pizza. In real economies, millions of different goods and services are produced, ranging from cars at an assembly plant to haircuts sold by a local barber. If our goal is to measure the overall output of an economy, we are faced with the problem of how to add together these goods and services. How do you add 60,000 cubic meters of natural gas, 1,000 trucks, and 2,000 head of cattle (to pick just a few examples of goods produced in Argentina)?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p02">We need a common denominator. Economists use the <em class="emphasis">market value</em> of the goods and services. This means that the common denominator is dollars in the United States, pesos in Argentina, kroner in Sweden, euros in Portugal, and so on. Nominal GDP equals total output produced in a year, valued at the actual market prices prevailing in that year. We choose market value for two reasons. One is simplicity: data on the market prices of goods and services are relatively easy to come by. The second reason is much more important. Market value tells us how much people are willing to pay for different goods and services, which gives us a measure of the relative value of different commodities. For example, if a new laptop computer costs $2,000 and a new hardcover novel costs $20, then the market is telling us that people are willing to trade off these goods at the rate of 100 novels to 1 laptop. In effect, the market is telling us that the laptop is 100 times more valuable than the novel.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn18_001">We take as given here that the market price—which tells us how much people are willing to spend—is a reasonable measure of the value of a good or a service. More precisely, it measures the value of the good or service “at the margin,” meaning it measures the value of having one more unit of the good or the service. Explaining why this is usually a sensible interpretation of the market price (and when it is not) is a topic covered in microeconomics courses.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p03">Let’s look at an example of the calculation. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01_t01">Table 18.1 "Calculating Nominal GDP"</a> considers a very small economy that produces three goods and services: T-shirts, music downloads, and meals. We show data for two years. To calculate GDP in 2012, we take the market value of the T-shirts ($20 × 10 = $200), the market value of the music downloads ($1 × 50 = $50), and the market value of the meals ($25 × 6 = $150). Adding these, we discover that nominal GDP is $400:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">($20 × 10) + ($1 × 50) + ($25 × 6) = $200 + $50 + $150 = $400.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p04">Doing the same operations for 2013, we find that nominal GDP is $442:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">($22 × 12) + ($0.80 × 60) + ($26 × 5) = $264 + $48 + $130 = $442.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p05">We can see that lots of things changed between the two years. The price of T-shirts and meals slightly increased, while music downloads became cheaper. Firms produced more T-shirts and music downloads but fewer meals.</p>

Nominal GDP increased substantially relative to 2012. Dig a little deeper, however, and it is harder to interpret this change. Production increased for some products and decreased for others. Some prices increased, and others decreased. Was 2013 really better than 2012? We come back to this question shortly.</p>

        <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Final Goods and Services</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s02_p01">In <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s01_t01">Table 18.1 "Calculating Nominal GDP"</a>, we assumed that all of the goods and services purchased were purchased by their <em class="emphasis">final</em> users. That is, the T-shirts, music downloads, and meals were all purchased by households for consumption purposes. (Households are not the only group that consumes final goods and services in an economy. Firms, the government, and households in other countries can also be final consumers.) We term these final goods (T-shirts) and final services (music downloads and restaurant meals).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s02_p02">In contrast, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intermediate goods and services</a><span class="glossdef">Products that are used—and completely used up—in the production of other goods and services.</span></span> are products such as raw materials and energy that are used—and completely used up—in the production of other goods and services.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn18_002">There are two kinds of goods used in the production of other goods. Intermediate goods are completely used up as part of the production process. Capital goods—such as factories and machines—are not completely used up but live to produce another day. We discuss capital goods in more detail in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch20#cooperecon-ch20">Chapter 20 "Globalization and Competitiveness"</a>.</span> We do not include intermediate goods in GDP. Think about a bottle of wine, for example. It might be bought by a consumer at a wine store, in which case it is counted in GDP. Alternatively, it might be bought by a restaurant to sell with its meals. In this case, the cost of the meal is included in GDP, and <em class="emphasis">the cost of the wine is already included in the cost of the meal</em>. The restaurant may have purchased the wine from a supplier, but that purchase is <em class="emphasis">not</em> included as part of GDP. If both the sale of wine to the restaurant and the sale of that wine to a customer of the restaurant were counted in GDP, the same bottle of wine would be counted twice. By excluding the sale of intermediate goods in calculating GDP, we avoid such double counting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s02_p03">Being intermediate is therefore not a feature of the good itself. It depends on how the good is used. Wine sold to a consumer directly is a final good; wine sold to a restaurant is an intermediate good. This fits with the idea that we want GDP to measure goods as they are valued by consumers.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s03_p01">Most of the time when we talk about an economy, we are speaking of a particular country. Thus we talk about US GDP, Argentine GDP, Indian GDP, or Uruguayan GDP. Similarly, most of the statistics that are collected refer to economic activity within a country. The term <em class="emphasis">economy</em> can be much more general, though, for it simply means a particular set of households and firms. We can speak of the world economy, the North Dakota economy, the Buenos Aires economy, or even the economy of a street of your hometown. The basic concepts are the same no matter what region we choose to discuss.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Over a Given Period</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s04_p01">GDP is measured over a specified period of time. In principle, that time period could be anything—a week, a month, a quarter (three months), or a year. In the United States and many other countries, GDP is <em class="emphasis">measured</em> on a quarterly basis. However, it is typically <em class="emphasis">reported</em> on an annual basis. In other words, government statisticians might measure GDP for the first three months of 2012 and find that it was $4 trillion. That is, over that three-month period, $4 trillion worth of goods and services was produced. The number would typically be reported as “$16 trillion on an annual basis.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s04_p02">It does not make any sense to talk about US GDP at the instant the clock strikes noon on February 29, 2012. The amount of GDP produced at any instant of time is, for all intents and purposes, zero. Instead, we think of GDP as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">flow</a><span class="glossdef">Any variable that has a time dimension.</span></span>. We can count the number of pizzas produced only if we specify some interval of time. Other variables can be sensibly measured even at a given instant. For example, we could—in principle at least—count the number of pizza ovens in existence at any given time. The number of pizza ovens at a point in time is an example of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stock</a><span class="glossdef">Any variable that can be measured in principle at an instant of time.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s02_s04_p03">The requirement that we count goods and services produced in a certain period means that we should also ignore the <em class="emphasis">resale</em> of goods produced in earlier periods of time. If a construction company builds a new house and sells it to you, the production of that home is counted as part of GDP. By contrast, if you buy a house that is 10 years old, the sale of that house is not counted in GDP. (However, if you employed a real estate company to find the old house for you, payment to that company would be included as part of GDP.) In the same way, if you purchase a used textbook that was produced 3 years ago, that purchase is not counted in GDP.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s03_p05">The first thing to do is to work out if 300 million pesos is a big number or a small number.

If you heard on the radio that nominal GDP was expected to grow by 300 million pesos in a 300-billion peso economy, the correct conclusion would be that nominal GDP would hardly change at all. By contrast, if the news announced a projected increase in nominal GDP of 30 billion pesos, the percentage change is 30 billion/300 billion = 0.1 = 10 percent. This is a substantial change in nominal GDP.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Measuring Real GDP</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_p01">In your bid to understand the economy of Argentina, you have seen that nominal GDP increased by one-third between 1993 and 2002. One possibility is that Argentina is producing one-third more pizzas than it was a decade ago—30 billion pizzas instead of 22.5 billion pizzas. This would be good news. Producing more pizzas is something we would normally think of as a good thing because it means that we are experiencing economic growth: there are more goods and services for people to consume.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_p02">In talking to people about the Argentine economy, however, you learn something disconcerting. They tell you that the prices of goods and services are greater this year than they were last year and much greater than they were a decade ago. You begin to wonder: perhaps Argentina is producing no more pizzas than before but instead pizzas have become one-third more expensive than they formerly were. We would typically feel very differently about this outcome. Yet another possibility is that there has been an increase in both the number of pizzas produced <em class="emphasis">and</em> the price of pizza, and the combined effect doubled nominal GDP. We need a way of distinguishing among these different possibilities.</p>
        <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Separating Nominal GDP into Price and Output</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p01">In our pizza economy, it is easy to tell the difference between an increase in production and an increase in prices. We can measure increased production by counting the number of pizzas, and we can measure increased prices by looking at the price of a pizza. We call the number of pizzas <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real gross domestic product (GDP)</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of production that has been corrected for any changes in overall prices.</span></span> (the word <em class="emphasis">real</em> here indicates that we are effectively measuring in terms of goods and services rather than dollars), and we call the price of a pizza the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price level</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of average prices in the economy.</span></span> in the economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p02">Then it follows that</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">nominal GDP = price level × real GDP.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p03">In our example, the price level is 10 pesos, and real GDP is 30 billion pizzas. Multiplying these numbers together, we find that nominal GDP is indeed 300 billion pesos. Sometimes, for shorthand, we use the term <em class="emphasis">price</em> to mean the price level in a given year and the term <em class="emphasis">output</em> to mean real GDP in a given year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p04">Real GDP is the variable that most interests us because it measures the quantity of goods and services produced in an economy. We would therefore like to find a way to decompose nominal GDP into the price level and the level of real GDP in actual economies. But real economies produce lots of different goods and services, the prices of which are continually changing. In addition—unlike our fictional economy, where it makes sense to measure real GDP as the number of pizzas—there is no “natural unit” for real GDP in an actual economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p05">In fact, even in our pizza economy, there is still an arbitrariness about the units. Imagine that we cut each pizza into 10 slices. Then we could just as easily say that real GDP is 300 billion pizza slices instead of 30 billion pizzas, but that the price level—the price per slice—is 1 peso. We would still conclude that nominal GDP—the number of slices multiplied by the price per slice—was 300 billion pesos.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p06">So is it possible to say, in a real economy producing multiple goods and services, that nominal GDP is equal to the product of the price level and the level of real GDP? Does it still make sense to write</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">nominal GDP = price level × real GDP</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p07">as we did for the pizza economy? The answer, as it turns out, is yes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p08">To see how this works, we begin by looking at how prices and output change from one year to another. Specifically, we divide 2013 nominal GDP by 2012 nominal GDP. This is one measure of the growth in nominal GDP from 2012 to 2013.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn18_003">Specifically, this measures the <em class="emphasis">gross growth rate</em> of nominal GDP. It is equal to 1 + the percentage change in nominal GDP. See the toolkit for details of the mathematics of growth rates.</span> Remember that nominal GDP equals total output produced in a year, valued at the prices prevailing in that year. Comparing nominal GDP in 2012 and 2013 therefore gives us</p>

By contrast, <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s02_t01">Table 18.3 "Real GDP Using 2012 as the Base Year"</a> shows that, when valued in year 2012 dollars, the total output of this economy in 2013 is $425.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s02_p05">Nominal GDP increased by 10.5 percent between the two years, but real GDP is increased by only 6.25 percent. From this we see that not all of the increase in nominal GDP is due to increased output. Some of the increase is because prices increased between 2012 and 2013.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s02_p06">In our pizza economy, we said that nominal GDP was equal to the price per pizza multiplied by the quantity of pizza. In our example here, we have calculated something very similar. Nominal GDP equals the price level multiplied by real GDP. In the base year, the price level equals 1 (that is what it means to choose the base year), and so real GDP equals nominal GDP in that year. Because we can calculate the increase in the price level and the increase in real GDP from one year to the next, we can obtain a time series for the price level and a time series for real GDP. In each year, nominal GDP equals the price level in that year times real GDP in that year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s02_p07">There is, however, one difference between the calculation for our pizza economy and measurement in real economies. In the pizza economy, because there was a single good, we were able to measure real GDP in physical units—the number of pizzas. In real economies, there is no single good, and so we measure real GDP in base year dollars rather than as a physical quantity. The price level in, say, 2013 is not, strictly speaking, the price of real GDP in terms of 2013 dollars but rather is the price of a base year dollar in terms of 2013 dollars.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s02_p08">But this is a technical difference. From an intuitive point of view, it is simplest to think about real GDP as being a physical quantity—a number of pizzas. In this book we therefore imagine that real GDP is actually a bundle of goods and services all melded together to create a composite good. We call that good “units of real GDP,” and we call the price level the price of a unit of GDP. In fact, we could think about the pizza economy in that same way. Even a basic pizza is itself composed of dough, sauce, and cheese: it is a bundle of items melded into one. So when we talk about the physical quantity of pizza, we are really talking about the number of bundles of these ingredients. Likewise, when we talk of real GDP, we are talking about a bundle of goods that we measure in base year dollars.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch18_s01_s04_s02_p09">Real GDP is our most basic measure of economic performance. It is a very broad measure because it tells us how much economic activity of any kind (at least, any kind that we can measure) is going on in our economy. Real GDP tells us how much we have produced of all the different goods and services that people enjoy and want to consume. For this reason, real GDP statistics are among the most closely watched of all the figures released by a government.</p>

By averaging, this measure has the virtue that calculations of real GDP are less sensitive to the selection of an arbitrary base year.

Argentina became poorer, not richer, in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The presence of luxury goods stores, for example, is a reminder that Argentina was a relatively rich country, but the absence of shoppers in those stores tells you that people are not feeling very rich at this time.</p>
