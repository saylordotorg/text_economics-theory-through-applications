<span class="title-prefix">31.36</span> The IS-LM Model</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_p01">The IS-LM model provides another way of looking at the determination of the level of short-run real gross domestic product (real GDP) in the economy. Like the aggregate expenditure model, it takes the price level as fixed. But whereas that model takes the interest rate as exogenous—specifically, a change in the interest rate results in a change in autonomous spending—the IS-LM model treats the interest rate as an endogenous variable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_p02">The basis of the IS-LM model is an analysis of the money market and an analysis of the goods market, which together determine the equilibrium levels of interest rates and output in the economy, given prices. The model finds combinations of interest rates and output (GDP) such that the money market is in equilibrium. This creates the LM curve. The model also finds combinations of interest rates and output such that the goods market is in equilibrium. This creates the IS curve. The equilibrium is the interest rate and output combination that is on both the IS and the LM curves.</p>
    <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">LM Curve</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_p01">The LM curve represents the combinations of the interest rate and income such that money supply and money demand are equal. The demand for money comes from households, firms, and governments that use money as a means of exchange and a store of value. The law of demand holds: as the interest rate increases, the quantity of money demanded decreases because the interest rate represents an opportunity cost of holding money. When interest rates are higher, in other words, money is less effective as a store of value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_p02">Money demand increases when output rises because money also serves as a medium of exchange. When output is larger, people have more income and so want to hold more money for their transactions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_p03">The supply of money is chosen by the monetary authority and is independent of the interest rate. Thus it is drawn as a vertical line. The equilibrium in the money market is shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_f01">Figure 31.28 "Money Market Equilibrium"</a>. When the money supply is chosen by the monetary authority, the interest rate is the price that brings the market into equilibrium. Sometimes, in some countries, central banks target the money supply. Alternatively, central banks may choose to target the interest rate. (This was the case we considered in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch25#cooperecon-ch25">Chapter 25 "Understanding the Fed"</a>.) <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_f01">Figure 31.28 "Money Market Equilibrium"</a> applies in either case: if the monetary authority targets the interest rate, then the money market tells us what the level of the money supply must be.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_p04">To trace out the LM curve, we look at what happens to the interest rate when the level of output in the economy changes and the supply of money is held fixed. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_f02">Figure 31.29 "A Change in Income"</a> shows the money market equilibrium at two different levels of real GDP. At the higher level of income, money demand is shifted to the right; the interest rate increases to ensure that money demand equals money supply. Thus the LM curve is upward sloping: higher real GDP is associated with higher interest rates. At each point along the LM curve, money supply equals money demand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_p05">We have not yet been specific about whether we are talking about nominal interest rates or real interest rates. In fact, it is the nominal interest rate that represents the opportunity cost of holding money. When we draw the LM curve, however, we put the real interest rate on the axis, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_f03">Figure 31.30 "The LM Curve"</a>. The simplest way to think about this is to suppose that we are considering an economy where the inflation rate is zero. In this case, by the Fisher equation, the nominal and real interest rates are the same. In a more complete analysis, we can incorporate inflation by noting that changes in the inflation rate will shift the LM curve. Changes in the money supply also shift the LM curve.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">IS Curve</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s02_p01">The IS curve relates the level of real GDP and the real interest rate. It incorporates both the dependence of spending on the real interest rate and the fact that, in the short run, real GDP equals spending. The IS curve is shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_f02">Figure 31.29 "A Change in Income"</a>. We label the horizontal axis “real GDP” since, in the short run, real GDP is determined by aggregate spending. The IS curve is downward sloping: as the real interest rate increases, the level of spending decreases.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s02_p02">In fact, we derived the IS curve in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch25#cooperecon-ch25">Chapter 25 "Understanding the Fed"</a>. The dependence of spending on real interest rates comes partly from investment. As the real interest rate increases, spending by firms on new capital and spending by households on new housing decreases. Consumption also depends on the real interest rate: spending by households on durable goods decreases as the real interest rate increases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s02_p03">The connection between spending and real GDP comes from the aggregate expenditure model. Given a particular level of the interest rate, the aggregate expenditure model determines the level of real GDP. Now suppose the interest rate increases. This reduces those components of spending that depend on the interest rate. In the aggregate expenditure framework, this is a reduction in autonomous spending. The equilibrium level of output decreases. Thus the IS curve slopes downwards: higher interest rates are associated with lower real GDP.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Equilibrium</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s03_p01">Combining the discussion of the LM and the IS curves will generate equilibrium levels of interest rates and output. Note that both relationships are combinations of interest rates and output. Solving these two equations jointly determines the equilibrium. This is shown graphically in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s03_f01">Figure 31.32</a>. This just combines the LM curve from <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s01_f03">Figure 31.30 "The LM Curve"</a> and the IS curve from <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s02_f01">Figure 31.31 "The IS Curve"</a>. The crossing of these two curves is the combination of the interest rate and real GDP, denoted (<em class="emphasis">r</em>*,<em class="emphasis">Y</em>*), such that both the money market and the goods market are in equilibrium.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s04_p01">Comparative statics results for this model illustrate how changes in exogenous factors influence the equilibrium levels of interest rates and output. For this model, there are two key exogenous factors: the level of autonomous spending (excluding any spending affected by interest rates) and the real money supply. We can study how changes in these factors influence the equilibrium levels of output and interest rates both graphically and algebraically.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s36_s04_p02">Variations in the level of autonomous spending will lead to a shift in the IS curve, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s04_f01">Figure 31.33 "A Shift in the IS Curve"</a>. If autonomous spending increases, then the IS curve shifts out. The output level of the economy will increase. Interest rates rise as we move along the LM curve, ensuring money market equilibrium. One source of variations in autonomous spending is fiscal policy. Autonomous spending includes government spending (G). Thus an increase in G leads to an increase in output and interest rates as shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch31_s36_s04_f01">Figure 31.33 "A Shift in the IS Curve"</a>.</p>
