        <h3 class="title">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch29_s06_p01">We started this chapter by asking whether the United States should adopt a balanced-budget amendment to the constitution. This question has both political and economic ramifications.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch29_s06_p02">It is not our purpose in this book to answer this question, or others like it, for you. Most interesting questions do not have easy answers. Instead, they come down to assessments of costs and benefits and judgments about which frameworks best describe the world that we live in. Our intent here was to provide <em class="emphasis">you</em> with the ability to assess the arguments about a balanced-budget amendment and, more generally, the effects of deficit spending on the economy.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch29_s06_p03">We saw in this chapter that there are certainly both benefits and costs associated with deficit finance. Key benefits include the ability to spread out the payments for large government purchases and the opportunity to use deficits to stimulate economies in recession. The main cost of deficits is that they increase real interest rates, thus crowding out investment and slowing long-term growth.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch29_s06_p04">As we also saw, these effects might be tempered by an increase in household savings in response to government deficits. The evidence suggests that the Ricardian perspective on deficits has partial validity. Changes in government savings are likely to be partially, but not completely, offset by changes in households’ saving behavior.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch29_s06_p05">We also noted that a balanced-budget amendment would not absolve government of the difficult choices involved in balancing the budget. It is one thing to pass a law saying that the budget must be balanced. It is quite another to come up with the spending cuts and tax increases that are needed to make it happen.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch29_s06_p06">Meanwhile, time is passing. Go and look again at the size of the debt outstanding reported at the US Treasury (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np</a>). How much has it changed since you first checked it? How much has your share of the debt changed?</p>

            <li>For the example in the preceding table titled “Exercise”, are the deficits and surpluses due to variations in the level of GDP or fiscal policy? Suppose you were told that potential GDP was 4,000. Is there a full employment deficit or surplus when actual GDP is 3,000? Design a fiscal policy so that the budget is in balance when real GDP is equal to potential GDP.</li>
            <li>Draw a version of <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch29_s02#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s02_f02">Figure 29.7 "Deficit/Surplus and GDP"</a> using the data for tax receipts you calculated in the table titled “Tax Receipts and Income”, and assuming government purchases equal 475. At what level of GDP is the budget in balance?</li>
            <li>The text says that expansionary fiscal policy increases the deficit given the level of GDP. Would an expansionary fiscal policy necessarily increase the deficit if GDP changes as well?</li>
            <li>Compare <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch29_s03#cooperecon-ch29_s03_s01_f01">Figure 29.14 "Ratio of US Debt to GDP, 1791–2009"</a> (from 1940 onward) with <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch29_s01#cooperecon-ch29_s01_s05_f01">Figure 29.2 "US Surplus and Debt, 1962–2010"</a>. Why do the figures look so different from each other?</li>
            <li>Suppose that investment is very sensitive to real interest rates. What does this mean for the slope of the demand curve in the credit market? Will it make the crowding-out effect large or small?</li>

            <li>What happened to the budget deficits of European Union member countries during the financial crisis that started in 2008? Were these cyclically adjusted budget deficits?</li>
            <li>Using the CBO as a source, make a table of the budget deficits for the period 1990 to the present in constant rather than current dollars (that is, obtain figures for real receipts, outlays, and deficits). Describe the behavior of real receipts, real outlays, and the real deficit over this period. Does it differ qualitatively from the description in the text? (If necessary, check the toolkit for instructions on how to convert nominal variables into real variables.)</li>
            <li>Using the CBO as a source, make a table of the on-budget deficits for the period 1990 to the present. Compare these calculations with those reported in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch29_s01#cooperecon-ch29_s01_s03_t01">Table 29.2 "Recent Experience of Deficits and Surpluses (Billions of Dollars)"</a>. Explain the main differences between these tables.</li>
            <li>Each month, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) posts its monthly budget review. Look for the most recent monthly budget review. What are the largest outlays and revenues? How large are interest payments on the debt?</li>
            <li>We saw that the government budget went from surplus to deficit in 2002. Based on the discussion in the text, try to find two different things that happened around this time that might explain this change.</li>

            <li>Suppose that government purchases are 500 and the tax rate is 20 percent. Create a table to calculate the budget deficit for each level of income from 0 to 1,000, increasing by 50 each time. At what level of income does the budget balance? Compare your results to those in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch29_s02#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s02_t01">Table 29.8 "Deficit and Income"</a>.</li>

But assume that the level of debt outstanding at the start of the first period was 100, not 0. Assume that the interest rate is 2 percent each year. Add a column to <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch29_s01#cooperecon-ch29_s01_s01_t01">Table 29.1 "Calculating the Deficit"</a> to indicate the payment of interest on the debt. Calculate the deficit for each year and then the debt outstanding at the start of the next year. Also calculate the primary deficit in your spreadsheet.
