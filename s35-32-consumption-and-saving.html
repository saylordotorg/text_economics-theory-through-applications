<span class="title-prefix">31.32</span> Consumption and Saving</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_p01">The consumption function is a relationship between current disposable income and current consumption. It is intended as a simple description of household behavior that captures the idea of consumption smoothing. We typically suppose the consumption function is upward-sloping but has a slope less than one. So as disposable income increases, consumption also increases but not as much. More specifically, we frequently assume that consumption is related to disposable income through the following relationship:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">consumption = autonomous consumption + marginal propensity to consume × disposable income.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_p02">A consumption function of this form implies that individuals divide additional income between consumption and saving.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_l01">
        <li>We assume autonomous consumption is positive. Households consume something even if their income is zero. If a household has accumulated a lot of wealth in the past or if a household expects its future income to be larger, autonomous consumption will be larger. It captures both the past and the future.</li>
        <li>We assume that the marginal propensity to consume is positive. The marginal propensity to consume captures the present; it tells us how changes in current income lead to changes in current consumption. Consumption increases as current income increases, and the larger the marginal propensity to consume, the more sensitive current spending is to current disposable income. The smaller the marginal propensity to consume, the stronger is the consumption-smoothing effect.</li>
        <li>We also assume that the marginal propensity to consume is less than one. This says that not all additional income is consumed. When a household receives more income, it consumes some and saves some.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">More Formally</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p01">In symbols, we write the consumption function as a relationship between consumption (<em class="emphasis">C</em>) and disposable income (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup>):</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">C</em> = <em class="emphasis">a</em> + <em class="emphasis">bY</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup></span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p02">where <em class="emphasis">a</em> and <em class="emphasis">b</em> are constants. Here <em class="emphasis">a</em> represents autonomous consumption and <em class="emphasis">b</em> is the marginal propensity to consume. We assume three things about <em class="emphasis">a</em> and <em class="emphasis">b</em>:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">a</em> &gt; 0</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">b</em> &gt; 0</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">b</em> &lt; 1</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p03">The first assumption means that even if disposable income is zero (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup> = 0), consumption will still be positive. The second assumption means that the marginal propensity to consume is positive. By the third assumption, the marginal propensity to consume is less that one. With 0 &lt; <em class="emphasis">b</em> &lt; 1, part of an extra dollar of disposable income is spent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p04">What happens to the remainder of the increase in disposable income? Since consumption plus saving is equal to disposable income, the increase in disposable income not consumed is saved. More generally, this link between consumption and saving (<em class="emphasis">S</em>) means that our model of consumption implies a model of saving as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p05">Using</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup> = <em class="emphasis">C</em> + <em class="emphasis">S</em></span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p06">and</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">C</em> = <em class="emphasis">a</em> + <em class="emphasis">bY</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup></span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p07">we can solve for <em class="emphasis">S</em>:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">S</em> = <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup> − <em class="emphasis">C</em> = −<em class="emphasis">a</em> + (1 − <em class="emphasis">b</em>)<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup>.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p08">So −<em class="emphasis">a</em> is the level of autonomous saving and (1 − <em class="emphasis">b</em>) is the marginal propensity to save.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p09">We can also graph the savings function. The savings function has a negative intercept because when income is zero, the household will dissave. The savings function has a positive slope because the marginal propensity to save is positive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p10">Economists also often look at the average propensity to consume (APC), which measures how much income goes to consumption on average. It is calculated as follows:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">APC = <em class="emphasis">C</em>/<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup>.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p11">When disposable income increases, consumption also increases but by a smaller amount. This means that when disposable income increases, people consume a smaller fraction of their income: the average propensity to consume decreases. Using our notation, we are saying that using <em class="emphasis">C</em> = <em class="emphasis">a</em> + <em class="emphasis">bY</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup>, so we can write</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">APC = <em class="emphasis">a</em>/<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">d</em></sup> + <em class="emphasis">b</em>.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch31_s32_s01_p12">An increase in disposable income reduces the first term, which also reduces the APC.</p>
