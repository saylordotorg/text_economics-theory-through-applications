            <li>How does fiscal policy affect the budget deficit?</li>
            <li>How does the state of the economy affect the budget deficit?</li>
            <li>How do we determine whether a budget deficit results from fiscal policy or the state of the economy?</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_p02">Now that we have defined budget deficits, budget surpluses, and the government debt, it is time to examine what determines these economic variables. The budget deficit reflects two forces: the stance of fiscal policy and the state of the economy.</p>

Most countries have different levels of government, so some tax and spending decisions are made for the whole country, whereas others are made locally. In principle, we can include all levels of government in our discussion. This means that, in the United States, “government” can refer to the totality of local government, state government, and the federal government. In practice, though, it is the decisions of the federal government that have the main impact on the overall fiscal policy of the country. The same is true in other countries—local government decisions are not usually very important for the overall stance of fiscal policy.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s01_s02_p01">Our interest here is in deficits and the debt rather than the details of taxation, so we take a very simple approach to taxation. We assume that there is a constant tax rate that applies to all levels of income and abstract away from all the other complexities of the tax schedule. This view of the tax and transfer system is summarized by the following equation:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">net taxes = tax rate × income.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s01_s02_p02">We illustrate this relationship in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 29.5 "The Tax Function"</a>. The slope of the line is the tax rate. In other words, for every dollar increase in income, net tax receipts increase by the amount of the tax rate.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s01_s02_p03">Taxes depend positively on income because of the way the tax code is written. Conversely, transfers (such as unemployment insurance or Medicare payments) tend to depend negatively on income: when people are richer, they are less likely to need transfers from the government. The tax rate in the figure captures the overall effect: higher income increases net tax revenues both because people pay more taxes and because they receive fewer transfers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s01_s02_p04"><a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s01_s02_t01">Table 29.7 "Tax Receipts and Income"</a> provides an example of tax receipts at different levels of income, when the tax rate is 10 percent. At the level of an individual household, taxes increase and transfers decrease as the household’s income increases. At the level of the entire economy, exactly the same thing is true. As real GDP increases, tax receipts increase and transfers decrease. Increased income, holding the tax rate fixed, leads to increased tax receipts. At the same time, increases in the tax rate lead to higher tax receipts at each level of income. Thus there are two factors determining tax receipts in the economy: the tax rate and the overall level of economic activity.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s03_p01">Given that the deficit depends on both the level of real GDP and the stance of fiscal policy, it is useful to have a way to distinguish these two influences. Put differently, it is helpful to know if the deficit is large because of the level of economic activity or because of the choices of government spending and taxes. This distinction came to the forefront in the 2004 presidential election in the United States. One of the issues raised in the debates between President George W. Bush and Senator Kerry was how the forecasted surplus from 2000 turned into the massive deficits of 2004. Were the deficits caused by the state of the economy or the policy decisions undertaken by President George W. Bush? To answer such questions, we need to decompose changes in the deficit into changes due to fiscal policy and changes due to the level of economic activity.</p>

Suppose that, last year, the economy was at potential output and there was a cyclically adjusted <em class="emphasis">surplus</em> (point A). Now imagine that this year there is a government deficit. One possibility is that the economy went into recession, as in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s03_f02">Figure 29.10 "Cyclical Deficit"</a>, point B. This is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cyclical deficit</a><span class="glossdef">A deficit that occurs when a government budget is in deficit because of the low level of real GDP.</span></span> because it is due to the state of the business cycle. Another is that the stance of fiscal policy has changed—for example, because of an increase in government spending, as in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s03_f03">Figure 29.11 "Structural Deficit"</a>, point C. The CBO calls this a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">standardized deficit (or structural deficit)</a><span class="glossdef">A deficit that occurs when a government budget is in deficit because of expansionary fiscal policy.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn29_018">A key simplification in these pictures is that the level of potential GDP is independent of taxes and government spending. <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch27#cooperecon-ch27">Chapter 27 "Income Taxes"</a> explains why potential output itself might be affected by the tax code.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s04_p01">We have identified two factors that determine the size of the deficit: the stance of fiscal policy and the state of the economy. We can use this information to learn more about the effects of a balanced-budget amendment on the economy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s04_p02">Suppose that the economy is at potential output. A balanced-budget requirement would say that the economy must be neither in surplus nor in deficit at this point. In other words, a balanced-budget requirement describes the overall stance of fiscal policy. The deficit/surplus line must be shifted to ensure that it passes through the horizontal axis at potential output, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s04_f01">Figure 29.12 "Balanced-Budget Requirement"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para">A balanced-budget requirement implies that the full-employment deficit/surplus must be zero. The deficit/surplus line must pass through zero when real GDP equals potential output.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch29_s02_s04_p03">Now suppose that, for some reason, the economy goes into recession. In <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch29_s02_s04_f02">Figure 29.13 "Recession with a Balanced-Budget Amendment"</a>, this means that output goes from potential output to some lower level. We know that this leads to a deficit, which is shown as a shift from point A to point B. Under a balanced-budget rule, the government is not allowed to let this situation persist. Instead the government must respond by increasing taxes or cutting spending, moving the economy from point B to point C. Similarly, if the economy went into a boom, this would tend to lead to a surplus. The government would be forced to cut taxes or increase spending to bring the budget back into balance. A balanced-budget amendment would force the government to conduct <em class="emphasis">procyclical</em> fiscal policy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn29_019">In fact, the effects of a balanced-budget amendment would be even worse. The countercyclical fiscal policy would cause GDP to decrease even further, thus requiring even bigger cuts in spending or increases in taxes.</span></p>

                <li>At a given level of GDP, an expansionary fiscal policy increases the budget deficit, and a contractionary fiscal policy decreases the budget deficit.</li>
                <li>As the level of economic activity increases, tax revenues increase, transfers decrease, and the budget deficit decreases.</li>
                <li>By examining the cyclically adjusted budget deficit, it is possible to evaluate how much of the budget deficit is due to the state of the economy and how much is due to the stance of fiscal policy.</li>
